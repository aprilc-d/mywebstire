                    I am a Computer Science Student getting a minor in Math at McGill University. 
                    My primary hobbies are music, spending time with my dog, Moka, and skateboarding 
                    and programming of course ðŸ¥º!! I'm finised my second year of university, (really my third from cegep) and
                    have previously worked in the hellscape of retail and now I would much prefer
                    working an intership in my field of interest and study.
